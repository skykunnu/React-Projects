# React

- Node modules are the heart of react files.

- React was developed to reduce number of DOM Operations.

- React is a component based js framework. 

- In SPA (Single Page Application) only content that user needs to be updated gets loaded not the entire page/website.

- React is often described as a declarative library because it allows developers to describe what the UI should look like for a given state, rather than specifying how to achieve that state imperatively.

imperative - khud ka khud karna (independent)

declarative - khud ka kaam dusro se karwana (dependent) 

- React comes in two parts - react and react-DOM

- Ways of creating react project 

-> CRA (create-react-app)
-> VITE
-> CDN 
-> Manual (npm init)


- Babel - It is a transpiler which converts jsx code into html code so that old browser can understood the code.

- JSX(Javascript XML) - JSX is a syntax Extension (ie a js file can be extended into jsx) meaning I can do whatever things in jsx that I did in js. 

- JSX was created by facebook for react only. 

- JSX prevents XSS attacks. 

- In JSX you can pass style as an object. 

- Rules of writing JSX

-> We cannot return multiple elements. if we want to do so wrap it under div or fragments. when jsx converts into js it converts into function call, 

-> JSX uses cameCasing. 

-> JSX uses className reason to avoid naming conflict. 

-> In JSX you have to explicitly close the tags. 



- What is a component in react ? 

->  A component is a function that returns a UI element. 

-> react recommends to write the first letter of function name in caps because it helps react to differentiate between html and components.


- What is Props? 

-> It is simply a arguments to a component. 

-> Props are immutable.
